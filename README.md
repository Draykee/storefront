# Vendure Storefront

This is a demo storefront app which is designed to be used with the [Vendure ecommerce framework](https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure) as a back end.

The app is built with the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), with the data layer being handled by [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client).

Currently in the early stages of development. There will be proper documentation when there is more to show.
